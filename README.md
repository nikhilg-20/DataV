# 📢 Project Bulletin — Global Freshwater Use & Withdrawals (1901–2021)
# 🔍 What This Project Is About

This project analyzes over 100 years of global freshwater use to understand how water consumption has changed, which countries use the most water, and how reporting quality has evolved. We used Kaggle datasets, Python, Altair visualizations, and geospatial mapping to uncover long-term environmental trends.

# 📌 What We Did

● Cleaned and prepared global & country-level freshwater datasets <br>
● Standardized variable names and fixed ISO3/country mismatches <br>
● Removed duplicates and handled missing data <br>
● Applied log transformations to manage skewed withdrawal values <br>
● Built multiple visualizations including: <br>
● Global freshwater use over time (1901–2014) <br>
● Annual withdrawals for top 4 countries (1970–2021) <br>
● Log-scaled histogram + density distribution <br>
● 2021 choropleth world map <br>
● Yearly count of countries reporting data <br>

# ⭐ Key Findings

● Global freshwater demand has increased 5× since 1901<br>
● Fastest growth occurred between 1950–1990, driven by industrialization and agriculture<br>
● India, China, and the United States dominate global withdrawals<br>
● Water-use distribution is heavily skewed, with most countries consuming very little<br>
● Reporting improved significantly after the 1980s, making modern data more reliable<br>
● Africa and small island nations still show notable reporting gaps<br>

# 🧭 Why This Matters

These insights can guide discussions on:

● Water scarcity<br>
● Sustainable usage policies<br>
● International data reporting standards<br>
● Environmental planning for high-demand regions<br>

This project demonstrates how data visualization helps reveal hidden patterns in global resource use.
